# The Mercurial Triangle Tracker


## Project Description

This project enables a user to input three (or less) sample dimensions in a form to check whether the dimensions logically make a triangle. The project performs the following checks and gives the following feedback:
* If the dimensions are equal, it alerts the user that they could make an equilateral triangle.
* If two dimensions are equal, it alerts the user that they could make an isosceles triangle.
* If no dimensions are equal, it alerts the user that they could make an scalene triangle.
* If any of the dimensions are not integers, it alerts the user that they could not make a triangle.
* If any of the dimensions are equal to zero(0), it alerts the user that they could not make a triangle.

## Deployment

To deploy the program, stage it on Git and push it to GitHub. Then, create a gh-pages branch from your master branch in the local machine. Thereafter, push the project to gh-pages on GitHub. After that, the program will be ready for Deployment on Git Hub Pages

The live page can be found in the following link: [The Mercurial Triangle Tracker](https://mercurialmune.github.io/Triangle-Tracker/)

* After Deployment, the following image shows what the expected output would be.

##Behavior Driven Development
  As with any other reputable development project, the Mercurial Triangle Tracker followed a systematic process between its conceptualization stage and its actual implementation. First, it was considered that users needed to perform certain tasks. However, due to the simplicity of the program, there wasn't much users could do with it. However, it was assumed that in the least, users should:
  * Input at most three numbers
  * check if the numbers could produce a triangle.
  Considering these two desired behaviors, it was evident that the program should at least:
  1. provide an input method to hold at most three variable - we settled on a form
  2. perform arithmetic and logical operations to determine whether the dimensions given could yield a triangle
  3. display the results of the arithmetic and/or logical operations (whether the user had input a triangle)
