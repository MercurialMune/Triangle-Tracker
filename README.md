# Project Title

The Mercurial Triangle Tracker
##

This project enables a user to input three (or less) sample dimensions in a form to check whether the dimensions logically make a triangle. The project performs the following checks and gives the following feedback:
* If the dimensions are equal, it alerts the user that they could make an equilateral triangle.
* If two dimensions are equal, it alerts the user that they could make an isosceles triangle.
* If no dimensions are equal, it alerts the user that they could make an scalene triangle.
* If any of the dimensions are not integers, it alerts the user that they could not make a triangle.
* If any of the dimensions are equal to zero(0), it alerts the user that they could not make a triangle.
